My name is Nathan. 

I build software and occasionally [write about it](/blog) in this neat space I made.  Most of my time is spent engineering UIs and services on the web.  I'm interested in functional programming, simplistic design, and software languages in general.

This is a humble space.  You will find here a collection of my ramblings and a few of my projects.  Thank you for stopping by.
