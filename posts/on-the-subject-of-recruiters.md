I'm currently reading through [The 2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/) by Steve Dalton, and it's been eye opening mainly because I would never choose to read a book like this.  It has a lot of neat perspectives that I think apply well to job hunting in the software field and I would like to share more thoughts in a later post. Anyway...

It's strange that I'm even reading this book because of my initial reasoning for pursuing a career as a software engineer. The first and foremost hard truth is that I am a gigantic nerd that loves software, and in a futuristic Star Trek non-mirror universe I would code without pay for the benefit of humanity.  The other hard truth is that I am not a resourceful individual when it comes to networking and acquiring money, and a career in software allows me to get the most money with the least amount of effort on that front.

I have not yet had a seasoned career, but already I have enjoyed the ease of job availability and mobility that others in my field enjoy and, let's be real, take for granted.  Good software engineers are certainly worth the price but should not have a higher societal worth than teachers, first responders, or really any job that directly helps people. But I digress.

There are many recruiters in the IT field. Software engineers revel in their hot employer market so much that most actively *complain* about how much recruiters reach out.  Look not far and you will come across several three-part blog posts written by engineers about the best way to take a FIRM STANCE with these annoying recruiters. Since, after all, they work for YOU and will LOWBALL you out of your precious high salary because they are only taking advantage of the economical situation.  Plus, they want 8 years of React experience even though it's been out for only 7 years. Stupid, silly recruiter.

As a lazy software engineer, I've always appreciated the existence of recruiters and have hard time understanding why they seem to be so offensive to others.  Obviously not all recruiters are equal, and some effort is needed to weed out the spam, but the alternative is to forgo recruiters and put in no effort at all.

Effort, as it relates to a job search, is a primary focus behind The 2-hour Job Search.  The "2-hour" referring to the actual (and optimal) effort time needed to bootstrap a job search for maximum output.  As agile-loving, ticket-assigning, sprint-running developers, we should take note. Dalton's main takeaway point is that the modern job hunting is full of messy noise and psychological pitfalls.  By applying a new methodology to the process, as we do in the business world, we can lower our stress and increase our output.

Recruiters are the natural product of a business model thriving on the current mess of the job search process. Even seasoned software veterans have the potential to dry up their network and enter the event horizon that is the job search. And good recruiters have mastered the new art of piercing through the noise.  Although Dalton is a career-coach with a MBA background, I would have fully believed if he gained his industry expertise working as a senior recruiter.

One congruent example: according to the book, an initial correspondence to a first or second-degree job connection should be a short message of introduction and asking for a quick 15-minute *informational interview.*  No long statement-of-purpose is necessary nor effective, and the wording should be akin to "could you do me a favor?".  This struck me as an identical tactic used by recruiters to seek out a connection with candidates.  And it works with me - since after all, no strings are attached.
