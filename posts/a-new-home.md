This space has a new home, and a new name.

In college I had a radio timeslot where I adopted the monicker "DJ Imaginathan".  I didn't put much thought into the name; I needed something to write something down on the application form and I found it funny.  Years later, I still think it's both the greatest and stupidest alias I've ever gone by.

Anyway, I've moved the site to netlify CMS, using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to maintain and generate the site.  I've heard good things about this combination, and have been happy how quick I've been able to configure, deploy, and port my old content over.  Previously I was using github pages and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is also great.  But github pages required a bit too much tweaking for my tastes.  I just want to write blog posts and push to master and have the site magically update (which it does now!) rather than rely on my dinky collection of shell scripts to publish.

I plan to utilize netlify for future small projects, since it's stupidly easy to deploy to.  And it's free.  Maybe one day I'll discover the catch, but for now that's certainly pretty sweet.
