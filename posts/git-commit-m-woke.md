This is the first post I'm making that is not directly about software engineering or this site.  Although my intention is to continue writing mainly on the subject of software (I don't know much about anything else) I've been wanting to explore other ideas about the word we live in.  So let's ceremoniously kick this off with an uncontroversial topic: social justice and inclusivity.

I'd like to narrow in on one controversy in particular.  Following the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests of last year, there was movement within the open source community to replace terms like "master", "slave", "blacklist", "whitelist", and other non-inclusive terms.  Github stood out, vowing to change the default "master" branch in git repositories to "main". This was not an isolated event.  Companies, organizations, and individuals alike took a collective and hard stance against problematic terminology that was now loudly antiquated - after the collective shock to Americans that systematic racism still has strong roots within us.

I will not spend time addressing whether or not systematic racism permeates our history and present (it does) because I want to focus on what we, one year after witnessing a black man senselessly murdered by an American police officer, have done about it.  And more specifically, I want to talk about why the git controversy is a realization that we have done far too little.

I would argue that the cleanup of problematic terms within our lexicon is a good thing.  There simply is no good argument against it.  The most prominent concern, that "woke" culture is a slippery slope to fascism, is too ridiculous to be taken seriously.  The more neutral stance - "I don't think it's a big deal" - is much fairer.  But given the context that set off the latest BLM advocacies, and understanding the reactionary state to these events, these seemingly neutral terms are granted exception.  Addressing them is a form of solidarity to the cause, and there is a finite amount of time in the spotlight that can be used to make progress in areas that would otherwise be ignored.  

These areas are about language, how we communicate, and how it subtly affects our attitudes.  It is something that will naturally change over time, arguably exponentially faster given how fast our cultures have been changing the last two hundred years.  We choose the words we use, but to some extent they are chosen for us, by an unseen force emerged from collectivism.  

Like the seemingly innocuous institutions that indirectly impede social equity, we can pull the same curtain over our words - without realizing - since they only exist to us in the present.  When that curtain is pulled away, we have the choice to take action, to expediate the progress that would hopefully happen later.  The choice becomes clearer when we realize that the arrow of progress is not linear and eternal.  Our delusions that social progress will "just happen" begin to dim, as we realize present action is the only catalyst.

This is a long-winded and soap-boxy way of saying: I am in support of changing racist and problematic terms.
