The most recent stack overflow developer survey at the time of this writing has rated VBA as the most hated programming language of the year, completing its steady climb to the position for the last five or so years.  “Most hated” is defined as the language most begrudgingly used by developers at their day job. That is probably putting it lightly. It is hard to find much buzz or friendly enthusiasm for Visual Basic. In fact, most online opinion for VB seems to be split into two camps: those coming from other languages who are sick of its lack of modernity, or VB veterans who are upset with the constant modernization of the language. After all, it is old and somewhat domain specific. And though it is the foundation of many legacy windows applications, their source codes don’t quite have that special antiquity needed to trigger fond memories and appeal within programmers old and new alike.  

In third place is `VB.Net`, the “modern” flavor of Visual Basic retrofitted to integrate with the .NET platform.  It is one of three languages available in the .NET Common Language Runtime, and yet, its functionally identical yet better looking cousin C# is sits far ahead at #6 on the “most loved” languages list.  Ouch.

Now, I would argue that the stack overflow survey is silicon skewed.  By that I mean, of course stack overflow users love the programming languages that you would prefer to greenfield your startup with.  In the cutthroat, changing web world, frequent forays into new platforms and languages happen justifiably, albeit a little eagerly.  And just like how the ageist Silicon Valley tech unicorn companies view employees under the age of 30, VB.Net seems to be that experienced old fart who just won’t retire.
