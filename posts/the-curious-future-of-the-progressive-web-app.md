An evangelical post about progressive web apps (or PWAs for you cool kids) makes the rounds on HackerNews every six months or so.  The latest, at this time of writing, showcases a(nother)[ PWA app store](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22963822) in a promising display of harmonious embracement of a bright future for mobile applications.

You scroll down, past the two pat-on-the-back high ranking comments, and find to your dismay individuals confused and unconvinced about the staying power of the PWA:

 "I've never worked with a PWA, but it seems to always lag behind mobile apps" says one sacrilegious user.  

"Cool, I built a similar PWA store last year, but I've since abandoned it" laments another.

"How could this be?" you ask. "The name literally contains the word 'progressive'! Is the progressive web app struggle worth fighting for?"

To you I say, yes it is. But let us rise above the noise and lay some foundation for our knowledge.  Let us remember once and for all, what a PWA actually is.

## What is a PWA?

If you did a basic Google search, you would find this definition:

> A progressive web application is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.

That is quite an underwhelming answer. PWAs are just websites? The web apps we've been making all this time were *progressive?* The answer is *kind of.*

[This is the most comprehensive article](https://medium.com/@amberleyjohanna/seriously-though-what-is-a-progressive-web-app-56130600a093) I could find regarding the history of the term "progressive web app" and how its definition shifted over time.  If you have the time to read it, it's a wild ride.  Getting to the bottom of it all is like a boxcar kids detective story.  But for the lazy, I'll sum up the real main requirements for a PWA:

The confusion regarding the PWA term is similar to that of the term HTML5.  The [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
